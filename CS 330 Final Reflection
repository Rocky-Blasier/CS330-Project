CS 330 Final Reflection

In the beginning of the software design process, I used to decompose the main goal into smaller and easier components, 
and then determine the interaction between the components. 
In this case, it implied classifying the whole scene into circles and bricks, 
with each group having its own properties and behaviors. 
My involvement in this project was instrumental in me sharpening the fibustry of designing with modularity and reusability as 
the main objectives, whereby every part of the program was to be the clear part of the whole system.

When I make a program, my first step is to determine the features, second to build the code structure, and finally to make the 
code readable and efficient. Among other things, in this 3D scene I applied new techniques, like detecting collisions, 
dynamic object spawning, and physics-based motion. This was an iterative process, since I had to repeatedly test my work, 
change the parameters and fine-tune the behaviors to achieve the desired result. I have thus gone through all the stages of 
development starting from simply writing code that works to creating clean, well-structured, and visually attractive software.

Computer science offers me the means to achieve my aspirations by basically improving my problem-solving and critical-thinking 
skills. My exposure to computational graphics and visualizations has given me a new perspective on how math, physics, and 
programming can be combined to create engaging and realistic digital environments. The skills I have acquired will not only 
facilitate my learning process but will also be directly applicable in the professional fields such as software development, 
game designing, or interactive simulations.
